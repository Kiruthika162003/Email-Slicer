# Email-Slicer
Email Slicer is nothing but just a tool which will take an email id as an input.
It will perform slicing operations on it to return the username and the domain of the email id.
The email slicer is a quite handy program to get the username and domain name from an email address. 
You can play around and even customize it further and send a message to the user with this information.
This project is super simple and quick and it doesn't require any setup so let's quickly jump to coding and build this.
